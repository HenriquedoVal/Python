    "### Is admissible Overpayment\n",
    "\n",
    "After recently joining Instacart's beta testing developer group, you decide to experiment with their new API. You know that the API returns item-specific display-ready strings like \"10.0% higher than in-store\" or \"5.0% lower than in-store\" that inform users when the price of an item is different from the one in-store. But you want to extend this functionality by giving people a better sense of how much more they will be paying for their entire shopping cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app lets a user decide the total amount x they are willing to pay via Instacart over in-store prices. This you call their price sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to determine whether a given customer will be willing to pay for the given items in their cart based on their stated price sensitivity x.\n",

    "solution(prices, notes, x) = True.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-store prices of the first and the second items are 100, and the price of the third item is 70, which means the customer is overpaying 10 - 5 + 0 = 5, which they are willing to do based on their price sensitivity.\n",

    "\n",
    "The in-store price of the first item is 60, and the second item is 150. The overpayment equals 15 - 12 = 3, which is too much for the customer to be willing to pay.\n",
